## :closed_book: Abstract
Work From Home Hunter (WFHunter) was designed with a career in mind. Using React, I made an app that utilizes the [Jobicy API](https://jobicy.com/jobs-rss-feed?utm_source=apislist.com) to deliver the newest posted remote jobs listed on their site. This application utilizes React Router, PropTypes, E2E testing with Cypress and was also designed with accessibility in mind. 

## :book: Context
 1 week sprint, designed and engineered as a final solo project in mod 4 of Turing.

## :space_invader: Challenges 
- Using raw CSS, will be learning SCSS after this module.
- Cypress testing had issues with a reusable component being rendered for the favorites page.
- Receiving html elements as part of the content from the API.

## :dizzy: Wins
- Having a supported API without need for authentication.
- Being able to refactor components to be reusable, simplifying the rendering of the Job Container used for the home page and favorite page.
- Very smooth and streamlined build process from design to deployment. :)
